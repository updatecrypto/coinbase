<section><h3>The First Cipher Requiring A Decryption Key Was Developed In The 16Th Century.</h3><br/><p>The second form of encryption is public key cryptology. In today’s age of computers cryptography is often associated with the process where an ordinary plain text is converted to cipher text which is the text made such that intended receiver of the text can only decode it and hence this process is known as encryption. Roman encryption and cyphers circa 60 bc:</p><h3>The First Is Manual Cryptography, The Second Is Mechanized Cryptography, And The Third Is Digital Cryptography.</h3><br/><p>This chapter will cover cryptography from the 1800s up until the modern computer age.
